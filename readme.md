# Chaos Run - an event-based infinite platform runner
### Chaos Run uses an Events system as its core gameplay mechanic. Events can be things like acid rain falling down that you need to seek cover for, or icicles falling down that you need to dodge. Chaos Run was built with extensibility in mind, making it easier than ever for anybody to add their own, fully custom events.
